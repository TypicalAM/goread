- Downloading articles for later use
- Offline mode
- Customizable colorschemes
- OPML file support
- A nice and simple TUI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üìù The urls file

The urls file contains the categories and feeds that you are subscribed to! This file is generated by the program in the config directory (usually `~/.config/goread/urls.yml`) and looks similar to this:

```yaml
categories:
  - name: News
    desc: News from around the world
    subscriptions:
      - name: BBC
        desc: News from the BBC
        url: http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml
        blacklist_words:
          - example
  - name: Tech
    desc: Tech news
    subscriptions:
      - name: Wired
        desc: News from the wired team
        url: https://www.wired.com/feed/rss
      - name: Chris Titus Tech (virtualization)
        desc: Chris Titus Tech on virtualization
        url: https://christitus.com/categories/virtualization/index.xml
        whitelist_words:
          - qemu
```

You can edit this file with `goread edit urls` to change the app's contents in an automated manner (remember that you can also edit entries in the TUI!).

### üåÉ The colorscheme file

The colorscheme file contains the colorscheme of your application! It can be generated by hand or using
the `--dump_colors` flag. The colorscheme file is usually at `~/.config/goread/colorscheme.json` - here is how it looks like!

```json
{
  "bg_dark": "#161622",
  "bg_darker": "#11111a",
  "text": "#FFFFFF",
  "text_dark": "#47485b",
  "color1": "#c29fec",
  "color2": "#ddbec0",
  "color3": "#89b4fa",
  "color4": "#e06c75",
  "color5": "#98c379",
  "color6": "#fab387",
  "color7": "#f1c1e4"
}
```

You can use the `--get_colors` flag to generate a colorscheme from pywal. For that you have to supply it with the pywal `colors.json` file which is usually located at `~/.cache/wal/colors.json`. To generate the `colors.json` file you can run `wal -stni ~/wallpapers/example.png`.

### üìù The config file

You can configure custom keybindings for goread in `goread.yml` in the same directory as the urls file, for an example use `goread edit config` which will open up the configuration in your favorite `$EDITOR`.

## ‚ú® Contributing

If you have an idea or something doesn't work feel free to create an issue. If it is a bug remember to:

- Update using `go install github.com/TypicalAM/goread@latest` or `homebrew upgrade`
- Include output of `goread --version`
- Include logs which are usually located at `/tmp/goread.log` on linux and `%TMP%\goread.log` on Windows

When running tests (for example when packaging) you can disable online tests by setting the env var `TEST_OFFLINE_ONLY` to a truthy value (for example "YES").
