			<title><![CDATA[Don't Know Much About AI Art, But I Know What I Like!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p><strong>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 030. Marcel and Evan dissect the topic of art created by Artificial Intelligence using tools like Dall-E, Midjourney, and Marcel's current favorite, Stable Diffusion, and try to see if this is the beginning of the end of the world. Most specifically, the world of art, for artists. &nbsp;What does the word, "the", mean to an AI? Also, the boys compare notes on what they did during their summer, discuss music and musical covers, and argue vehemently over whether "Don't Stop Believing" by Journey is, in fact, a good song.&nbsp;</strong></p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Obsolescence Episode]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 029. Marcel and Evan riff, again, on the subject of virtual worlds, wherein Marcel gets ordained as a priest in an imaginary church, gets an honorary doctorate at an imaginary university (you can call him Dr. Marcel, if you like), and obtains dual citizenship from an imaginary country. Between the two of them, they discuss what any of this means in a world that is becoming increasingly virtual. Evan, meanwhile, tries out his new microphone and complains bitterly about tech hardware obsolescence. Who can blame him?</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Metaverse Is Boring!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is "TIC TEK TOE" episode 028 and one for which I (Marcel) must apologize up front. I decided to wear my gaming headset and just assumed that it would be just fine for the podcast. Instead, it's noise cancelling microphone cancelled far more than it should have and my audio sounds clipped and occasionally vanishes into the pits of wherever audio goes. Evan, on the other hand sounds just fine.</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Living Dangerously and Taking Public Transit]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is episode 027 of TIC TEK TOE, your light-hearted look at whatever comes into your hosts' heads. In today's episode, Evan and Marcel discuss slowly getting back out into the (hopefully increasingly) post pandemic world and what it feels like to travel right now. Evan heads east into Quebec and Marcel heads into Niagara Falls for an overnight stay. They discuss wine, feel-good television as a pandemic salve, fear, Jon Stewart's new show, fear, Ted Lasso and sportsball shows, fear, autism in movies and television, fear, aphantasia, a condition whereby a person has no 'inner eye' to visualize, fear, and what we did during the summer break (SPOILER: Marcel started making games in Unity).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fear not, and enjoy!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Che Guevara Posters and the Freedom to Be a Schmuck]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 26! Marcel and Evan discuss why neither owns a Che Guevara poster, hard to find centrists, progressophobia, why you really should not feed the trolls, platforming and deplatforming, empathy, moral panics, the future of work, the coming collaps of the commercial real estate market, Zoom, real live people, embracing avatars, Yoda (not baby Yoda), and dark circles. In short, the boys cover a lot of ground and, as usual, have trouble staying on topic. Heck, I can't even remember what the topic was. Enjoy!</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Amazon Deliveries on Mars!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 25! Woo Hoo! &nbsp;Marcel and Evan discuss the ethics of killing NPCs in video games, simulation theory wars, and why an otherwise respectable university would sabotage its standing in the Linux community. That last bit is juxtaposed with Evan making a blasphemous presentation at the Toronto Linux User Group, GTALUG. The boys also cover running graphical Linux apps in Windows, old style book printing and publishing, turtles, dwarves, giants, and tardigrades. Today's episode features the quintessential Canadian story, and yes, it involves a beaver. Or two. Now that we have drones on Mars, can Amazon deliveries on the Red Planet be far behind?&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[Cheesy NFT Graphics ]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 024, the episode they said we would never do. Marcel and Evan discuss cheese, because . . . well . . . CHEESE! The boys discuss their favourite types, chat about declining attendance in US churches and synagogues and whether Trump has anything to do with it. Because NFTs are a thing now, Marcel and Evan find ways to make fun of them, while decrying the insane price of graphics cards (assuming you can even get them), and whether this whole crypto thing just needs to go away. Then, there's that thing about RMS returning to the FSF which brings up the question of whether the FSF is even still relevant. The boys also discuss the man who should have been the 46th President of the US but will probably become mayor of the city that never sleeps, Andrew Yang.&nbsp;</p>

			<title><![CDATA[The Evil Episode . . . Eeeeeevil!!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is episode 023 of TIC TEK TOE, and we're calling this one "The Evil Episode" because it's all about evil, specifically who is evil, who isn't, and just what constitutes evil these days.&nbsp;Once upon a time, especially to those in the Free and Open Source Software (aka FOSS) world, it was Microsoft. These days, however, there's Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon (aka GAFA) fighting it out for the crown of ultimate evil. And Microsoft? They're starting to look like one of the good guys. The boys also discuss the banning and/or cancelling of Dr. Seuss, the de-sexing of Mr and Mrs Potato head, the Mars lander and what wind sounds like on Mars. Oh, and Marcel used the wrong microphone source in recording so his audio is kind of subpar.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is episode 022 of TIC TEK TOE. Marcel and Evan discuss cracking open a cold one, in this case fizzy water, renovation porn, the stock market along with the latest sort-selling GameStop madness, the awesome power of Reddit, the possibly even more awesome power of Elon Musk, Signal, MeWe, Animaniacs, and PSYCH. Oh, and Schitt's Creek, too!</p>
<p><strong>Links from the Show</strong></p>
<p>Sodastream discussion, spawned from me cracking open a cold one (PC fizzy water).</p>

Marcel and Evan discuss cracking open a cold one, in this case fizzy water, renovation porn, the stock market along with the latest sort-selling GameStop madness, the awesome power of Reddit, the possibly even more awesome power of Elon Musk, Signal, MeWe, Animaniacs, and PSYCH. Oh, and Schitt&apos;s Creek, too!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[No More Travel For You, but Have Some Cheese!]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 019. Marcel and Evan start out discussing cheese and its precursor, milk, move on to meat, including the plant based alternatives, Incredible Burger and Beyond Meat, after which Evan does his best to alienate GMO's foes. Moving on to a discussion of ultra-violence on TV with shows like Preacher and The Boys, the two slip into anime and video games. From there, it's VR, the end of business travel as we know it, including conference SWAG, open source virtual reality, and a teaser about an upcoming discussion where Marcel will point out why Evan just does not even begin to understand how intelligent technology is supposed to work. On, and Marcel coins a new word, "<em><strong>Ostimates</strong></em>", a combination of "Optimistic" and "Estimates." Make sure you use it everywhere! Finally, please support our little podcast by telling others about it and leaving us a rating wherever you find your podcasts. <strong>Thanks for listening!</strong></p>

			<itunes:summary>&lt;p&gt;This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 015. Today, Marcel and Evan visit the afterlife in VR, consider the world&apos;s loudest 21 seconds of silence, consider some Microsoft and Open Source conspiracy theories, wonder at the beauty of chroma key and Zoom backgrounds, mourn over the graves of many failed products, ask the tough questions about when good news becomes bad news, and generally chat about how we never cover the topics we think we&apos;re going to cover.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Fear is the Mindkiller, and Battery-Operated Bidets]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 013, from deep inside the heart of self-isolation. In this episode, Marcel and Evan discuss the strange world we all find ourselves living in, the climate of fear, the hazards of grocery shopping, Zoom going zoom and its security concerns, virtual reality headsets, virtual reality social environments, toilet paper, bidets, and why it's not so different for some people out there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Links From The Show</strong></p>
<p>Litany against fear, from DUNE, by Frank Herbert</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must not fear.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is the mind-killer.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will face my fear.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only I will remain.</p>
<p>"<em>So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself — nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.</em>" -- Franklin D. Roosevelt</p>

			<title><![CDATA[TIC TEK TOE Slips Into Virtual Reality]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>TIC TEK TOE, episode 012. Welcome to a bold experiment into the future of something or other. Let's be honest. It's hard to tell. Is it a podcast? Is it a virtual reality (VR) show? Is it just two guys mucking about in AltspaceVR and trying to see if it's possible to tie your shoes when there's only one controller? Marcel has been playing with VR for a long time, but Evan is a relative newcomer and Marcel, being that kind of guy, wanted to see how Evan would handle himself in this strange new world. This show is unusual in that it's both a podcast, and a YouTube video.</p>
<p>In this episode (if it's an episode), we discuss doing things in VR, the EU adopting Signal for instant messaging, and "Shitt's Creek", a comedy on Netflix and CBC that is mandatory viewing for all Canadians and non-Canadians alike. &nbsp;And, if you want to follow along with the video portion of this show, check it out here, on YouTube. <a href="https://youtu.be/sM_H0nxilJo">https://youtu.be/sM_H0nxilJo</a></p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>TIK TEK TOE, episode 009. &nbsp;In this final episode of the decade, or at least, this year, Marcel and Evan riff on Christmas gifts, VR games, Jumanji, Open Hardware vs closed borders, The Witcher, and several other diversions. Somewhere in there, they reminisce over the last decade of free software, a free and open Internet (the Overnet), and lots of other things you really don't want to miss. Oh, and Marcel learns about Gwen Stacy, or is it Gaven and Stacey?</p>

<p>A program is “free software” if the program’s users have the four essential freedoms:</p>
<p>1: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</p>
<p>2: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
<p>3: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</p>
<p>4: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</p>
<p>If software is licensed in a way that does not provide these 4 freedoms, then it is categorized as nonfree or proprietary.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Four Freedoms (of Free Software)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A program is “free software” if the program’s users have the four essential freedoms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If software is licensed in a way that does not provide these 4 freedoms, then it is categorized as nonfree or proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title><![CDATA[Stallman Resigns, Huawei does Linux, Deepin]]></title>
			<description><![CDATA[<p>Tic Tek Toe, episode 002 : In this episode, Evan and Marcel discuss the recent events surrounding Richard Stallman resigning from both M.I.T. and the Free Software Foundation. We also talk about another controversy, namely the ongoing security and trade concerns around Huawei and whether we should be worried about their new laptops running Deepin Linux. Even before Huawei was on Trump's list, there were some questions as to whether Deepin might include Chinese spyware. Finally, Marcel addresses some feedback about how he ends his episodes.&nbsp;</p>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is TIC TEK TOE, episode 1. In this, the first episode, Evan and Marcel discuss the signs that hell has frozen over as Richard Stallman speaks at Microsoft. They also discuss the end of Linux Journal and how that relates to traditional publishing, how to make money in an increasingly free digital age, and a new exploit targeting Linux servers. Sort of. Also, Marcel wants to register a complaint.</p>
